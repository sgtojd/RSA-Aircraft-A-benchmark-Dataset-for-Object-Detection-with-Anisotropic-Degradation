# RSA-Aircraft-A-benchmark-Dataset-for-Object-Detection-with-Anisotropic-Degradation
RSA-Aircraft is the first large-scale benchmark for Rotating Synthetic Aperture (RSA) imagery. It contains 35,704 images generated via full-link physical simulation, featuring realistic anisotropic degradation. It serves as a standard for evaluating detection algorithms under rotation-coupled blur.

## Dataset Description
The unique anisotropic degradation pattern of RSA systems introduces a severe domain shift when models trained on conventional clear images are applied to RSA imagery. Therefore, we construct the RSA-Aircraft dataset, which is built upon a full remote sensing imaging link. It enables the effective and fair training and evaluation of object detection algorithms for RSA images.
